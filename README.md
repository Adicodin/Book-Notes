# Book-Notes
This is a project for maintaining a personalized book notes web app. Here, one can store their book notes, rate them and sort them by different options to maintain and easily access their book notes.
<br>
This is inspired by Derek Sivers' Site for book notes - https://sive.rs/book. This is a capstone project for the UDEMY Web Development Course. It uses Open Library Covers API to fetch the cover images of books shown in the web app - https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers.
<br><br>
To use this project : 
1. setup database in postgres using commands given in queries.sql
2. cd (Change Directory) in terminal to this project's folder
3. use "npm i" to install all the dependencies used in the project
4. run "nodemon index.js" to start the server
5. access the site on "http://localhost:3000/"

This is how it will look :
